* dfm.el -- An Emacs porcelain for the dfm tool

dfm.el is a wrapper script around the DFM (DotFile Manager) tool that can be
found here: https://github.com/chasinglogic/dfm. It provides commands for
running dfm as well as adding hooks to automatically sync your dotfiles on
save.


** Commands

This package offers the following commands:

 - `dfm-sync`: Sync your dotfiles with your configured remote
 - `dfm-switch-profile`: Using ido completion search through and switch to a dfm profile
 - `dfm-add-file`: Add a file to the current dotfile profile
 - `dfm-add-current-file`: Add the currently editing file to the current dotfile profile
 - `dfm-go-to-current-profile`: Open a dired buffer at the root of the current profile repo
 - `dfm-remove-profile`: Search through and remove a given dotfile profile

*** Auto Sync Feature

Additionally, you can enable the auto sync feature, which will automatically
sync after you save any dotfile that is in the currently active dfm profile. To
enable simply add `(setq dfm-sync-dotfiles-on-save t)` to your emacs init file.
(Commonly: `~/.emacs`)
